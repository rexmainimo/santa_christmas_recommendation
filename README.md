This project implements a two-step recommendation system leveraging Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

##Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis:

A probabilistic model to classify input text as positive or negative sentiment based on word frequencies.
Lightweight and interpretable, using a Bag of Words (BoW) approach for feature representation.

##Content-Based Gift Recommendation with KNN:

A content-based recommendation system that uses cosine similarity to match user preferences (from input text) with product descriptions.
Encodes products and user input into feature vectors for efficient similarity computation and ranking.
